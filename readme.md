## Engine & Runtime

- [QuickJS-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs): version 2019-07-09, qjs executable, 64 bits, compiled with -O2.
- [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/): version 2019-07-09, qjs executable, 64 bits, compiled with -O2.
- [DukTape](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape): version 2.3.0, duk executable, 64 bits, compiled with -O2.
- [XS](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable): version 8.8.0, xst executable, 64 bits, compiled with -O3. The engine cannot correctly run the RegExp test, so it was disabled.
- [MuJS](https://github.com/ccxvii/mujs): version 1.0.6, mujs executable, 64 bits, compiled with -O2. JS_STACKSIZE and JS_ENVLIMIT were increased to 32768 to run EarleyBoyer. REG_MAXSUB was increased to 12 to run RegExp.
- [JerryScript](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript): git version 2b8c4286, jerry executable, 64 bits. The engine could not run EarleyBoyer, RegExp and Splay.
- [Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes): version 0.1.0, 64 bit Linux binary downloaded from here. The benchmark was run with the -O option (=enable expensive optimizations).
- [V8](https://v8.dev/): version 7.7.289, Linux 64 bit executable downloaded from here.
- [txiki.js](https://github.com/saghul/txiki.js): A tiny JavaScript runtime
- [llrt](https://github.com/awslabs/llrt): LLRT (Low Latency Runtime) is a lightweight JavaScript runtime
- [deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno): A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- [node](https://github.com/nodejs/node): Node.js JavaScript runtime
